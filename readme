# Wireless Communication using nRF24L01, Keypad, and LCD Display

This project demonstrates wireless communication between two Arduino devices using nRF24L01 modules. One device acts as the transmitter, sending data entered on a keypad, and the other acts as the receiver, displaying the received message on an LCD screen.

## Components Used

### Transmitter:
- *Arduino Board* (e.g., Arduino Uno, Nano, etc.)
- *nRF24L01 Wireless Transceiver Module*
- *4x4 Keypad*
- *16x2 I2C LCD Display*
- *Wires and Power Supply*

### Receiver:
- *Arduino Board* (e.g., Arduino Uno, Nano, etc.)
- *nRF24L01 Wireless Transceiver Module*
- *16x2 I2C LCD Display*
- *Wires and Power Supply*

## Libraries Required
The following libraries need to be installed for this project:

1. *Keypad Library* - To handle keypad input
2. *RF24 Library* - To communicate with the nRF24L01 module
3. *LCD_I2C Library* - To control the I2C LCD
4. *Wire Library* - For I2C communication (already included in Arduino IDE)

You can install these libraries through the Arduino Library Manager (Sketch -> Include Library -> Manage Libraries) or by downloading them from their respective sources.

## Connections

### Transmitter:

1. *Keypad*:
   - Connect the keypad rows and columns to digital pins 2 to 9 on the Arduino.

2. *nRF24L01*:
   - *CE Pin*: Connect to pin 10 on Arduino
   - *CSN Pin*: Connect to pin 14 on Arduino
   - *MOSI, MISO, SCK*: Connect to respective SPI pins on the Arduino (11, 12, 13)

3. *I2C LCD Display*:
   - *SDA Pin*: Connect to A4 on Arduino
   - *SCL Pin*: Connect to A5 on Arduino

### Receiver:

1. *nRF24L01*:
   - *CE Pin*: Connect to pin 10 on Arduino
   - *CSN Pin*: Connect to pin 14 on Arduino
   - *MOSI, MISO, SCK*: Connect to respective SPI pins on the Arduino (11, 12, 13)

2. *I2C LCD Display*:
   - *SDA Pin*: Connect to A4 on Arduino
   - *SCL Pin*: Connect to A5 on Arduino

## How It Works

### Transmitter Code:

1. The user enters a string of characters using the 4x4 keypad.
2. Each character is displayed on the LCD.
3. Once the user presses the # key, the entered string is sent via the nRF24L01 module.
4. The LCD then displays the sent message for a short duration before clearing.

### Receiver Code:

1. The receiver listens for incoming data using the nRF24L01 module.
2. When data is received, the message is displayed on the LCD.
3. If the received message is longer than the display width, the LCD scrolls to show the entire message.
4. The display is cleared after a short delay, and the receiver continues to listen for new messages.

## Key Points:

- *Character Limitation*: The maximum length of the string that can be sent is 32 characters.
- *Scrolling Display*: If the message is longer than 16 characters, it will scroll left on the LCD to accommodate the entire text.
- *Message Confirmation*: The transmitter LCD confirms the sent message, while the receiver LCD displays the received message.

## Example Scenario

1. *Transmitter*: You enter a message like 1234A*0# on the keypad. The LCD shows the characters as they are entered. When you press #, the entire message is sent wirelessly.
   
2. *Receiver*: The receiver gets the message and displays 1234A*0 on its LCD. If the message exceeds 16 characters, it scrolls the display to show the complete message.

## Important Notes:

- Ensure that both the transmitter and receiver are powered properly and that the nRF24L01 modules are connected with minimal interference.
- Make sure the LCD address in the code matches the address of your I2C LCD module. The address 0x27 is commonly used, but it may vary depending on your module.
- You may need to adjust the *RF24_PA_LEVEL* depending on your range requirements. 

## Troubleshooting

1. *No Communication*:
   - Verify the wiring of the nRF24L01 modules and ensure that they are connected to the correct pins.
   - Check if the address used for communication ("00001") matches in both transmitter and receiver code.

2. *LCD Not Displaying*:
   - Ensure that the I2C address of the LCD is correct. If necessary, use an I2C scanner to find the address.

3. *Keypad Issues*:
   - Check the wiring of the keypad to ensure that the rows and columns are correctly connected to the respective pins on the Arduino.
